# ipl-data-analysis-project-spark

## Introduction 
In this project, you will execute an End-To-End Data Engineering Project on IPL Data Analysis using Spark.

## Apache Spark
Apache Spark is an open-source analytics engine for big data workloads that uses in-memory caching and optimized query execution. It can run on its own, in the cloud, against diverse data sources, and on Apache Hadoop, Apache Mesos, or Kubernetes. Spark has five key components:
Spark Core: A general-purpose, distributed data processing engine
SQL: Built-in module for SQL
Streaming: Built-in module for streaming
Machine learning: Built-in module for machine learning
Graph processing: Built-in module for graph processing

## Databricks
Databricks is a cloud-based platform that provides tools for processing and transforming large amounts of data. It's built on Apache Spark and distributed cloud computing environments like Azure and AWS. Databricks integrates with a variety of data sources, developer tools, and partner solutions
